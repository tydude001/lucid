Architecture, stack decisions, and open questions live in [PLAN.md](PLAN.md).
The competitor/dependency survey behind those decisions is in
[PRIOR-ART.md](PRIOR-ART.md). Open-item status lives in the wiki, not here.

## Things that will bite you

All three are cases where the training prior is confidently wrong. Check the
installed package or the upstream repo, not your memory.

- **The MCP SDK is v2. `FastMCP` no longer exists** — it is `MCPServer`, from
  `mcp.server` (and there is no `mcp.server.fastmcp` module). Training priors
  overwhelmingly say `FastMCP`; check the installed package before writing
  server code, not your memory of the API.
- **auto-editor is Nim, and PyPI is stale.** `pip install auto-editor` gets
  29.3.1; upstream ships 31.x. There is no Python API — shell out to the binary,
  like ffmpeg.
- **OTIO's edit algorithms are C++ only.** `overwrite`/`insert`/`trim`/`slice`/
  `ripple`/`roll`/… have no Python bindings; `opentimelineio.algorithms` gives
  you only trimming, flattening, and transition expansion. Cutting means
  hand-rolled track surgery over Track/Clip/Gap and `source_range`.

## Conventions

- Every MCP tool gets a matching `lucid` CLI subcommand. The CLI is how the
  same operation gets scripted and debugged without an agent in the loop, so
  parity is a feature, not overhead.
- Tests exercise the real server process over stdio (`tests/test_server_stdio.py`),
  not just the tool functions. Unit-testing a tool body proves nothing about
  whether it is registered or reachable.
- Resolve media through `media.media_path()`, never `root / clip["media"]`. A
  `media/` entry is optional — the NAS rejects symlinks, so import falls back to
  referencing the source in place (wiki `files.md`).
