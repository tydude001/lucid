"""Probing and registering source media.

`ffprobe` is the only thing that reads media metadata here — lucid never
guesses fps or duration from a filename or a container assumption.

Imported media is *linked*, not copied, by default: `media/<clip_id><ext>` is a
symlink to wherever the file actually lives. A 74 MB VO on the NAS should not
be duplicated to be edited, and a broken symlink is a visible failure rather
than a silently wrong path. `copy=True` takes a real copy when the source is
somewhere that will not survive.

Not every filesystem cooperates — see `_place`. Read paths through
`media_path()` rather than assuming a `media/` entry exists.

    the Edit lane's producer carries no property at all and MLT picks — and

# -- the preview proxy ----------------------------------------------------
#
# PLAN.md § The preview proxy transcode. The structural rule, and the whole
# reason this is a second function rather than a branch inside `media_path()`:
# **the proxy never enters the manifest, and `media_path()` gains no branch.**
#
# `media_path()` prefers the attenuated copy by reading a manifest key, and
# that is exactly what makes attenuation transparent to `export`, `verify`,
# `check_frames` and every other downstream op for free. A `proxy` key folded
# into the same chain would inherit the identical reach, and the thing it would
# reach is the render: a delivered file at preview quality. So `export` cannot
# see a proxy because it never calls `preview_path` — not because a resolution
# order was written carefully.

#: A proxy is for a `<video>` in a browser window, not for delivery, so it is
#: downscaled. Measured on a 1080x1920 5.28 Mbps render of real footage: full
#: resolution at CRF 23 costs 24.2 MB/min, this costs 3.2 MB/min and encodes
#: 2.9x faster. That 7.6x is what lets `cache/proxy/` keep one entry per clip
#: with no eviction policy — the film's whole footage proxies to ~70 MB.
#:
#: Downscaling is geometrically free here and that had to be checked rather
#: than assumed: `player.js`'s `place()` positions the element by
#: `timeline_view`'s `dest` rect in *canvas* coordinates with `objectFit:
#: fill`, and never reads `videoWidth`/`videoHeight`, so a uniform downscale
#: draws in exactly the same place. Nothing else measures a proxy's pixels.
