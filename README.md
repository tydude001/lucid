# lucid

An open-source, local-first AI video editor. A lucid dream is a dream you
control — lucid is the answer to [Daydream](https://www.daydreamvideo.com):
the same agent-driven editing workflow, but open, unmetered, and running
entirely on your own hardware.

## The idea

Daydream's product is a desktop editor where AI agents (Claude Code, Codex)
do the editing — trim by transcript, remove silences, add captions and motion
graphics — via chat or an MCP server, with metered transcription hours,
processing hours, and MCP calls.

Every hard primitive under that product already exists as mature open source:

| Capability | Open-source primitive |
|---|---|
| Cutting, concat, captions, rendering | ffmpeg |
| Local transcription (30+ languages) | whisper.cpp / faster-whisper |
| Silence and bad-take removal | auto-editor |
| Timeline data model + NLE export | OpenTimelineIO (FCPXML, etc.) |
| Programmatic motion graphics | Motion Canvas |

lucid is the orchestration layer on top: an MCP server that exposes those
primitives as editing tools to any agent, so "cut the part where I stumble
and caption the rest" becomes a chat message instead of an afternoon.

## Scope, in tiers

1. **Headless MCP server + CLI** — import, transcribe, cut by transcript,
   remove silences, caption, render, export MP4/OTIO. ~70% of the value for
   anyone already living in an agent CLI. This is the MVP.
2. **Preview/timeline web UI** — see what the agent did before rendering.
3. **Full desktop editor** — explicitly *not* a goal. OTIO export hands
   finishing work to Resolve/Premiere/Final Cut, same as Daydream does.
